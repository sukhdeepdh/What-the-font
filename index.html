            <p>More than often</p>
            <p>We don't take advantage of the beauty all around us</p>
            <p>Oh more than often</p>
            <p>We take each other's time for granted because we're always around us, oh yeah</p>

        <section>
           
            <p>Like the blue skies</p>
            <p>We don't appreciate the sun until it rains (oh we never do)</p>
            <p>Try to see it like a child</p>
            <p>Oh the innocence in everything we do</p>
